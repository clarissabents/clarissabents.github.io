            <p>I have a cat named Winnie, named after Winnifred Sanderson from Hocus Pocus! I love all things spooky and Halloween themed, as well as horror movies, music, and making oddly specific spotify playlists for myself (example: I have a playlist called "songs that had a deathgrip on 10 year old me" that is filled with only songs from Disney Channel which honestly still are all bangers) </p>
